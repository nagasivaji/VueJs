/*
    # To use data comming from setup hook into our Vue component we have to return those data in object format

    # return {name, EmpId: id};
    # From above return statement we can obser two diffrent patterns
    # Here name is retured as name. So we can use that as name in our components
    # But id is returned as EmpId. So we can use id as EmpId in our components.


    # If we want to access function defined in setup then they also must be returned from setup     function as show in above example

    ``````````````````````````````````` NOTE ````````````````````````````````````````````````````

    # If tha data in the data hook gets chnaged it will reflect the data in the component as well. Because they are REACTIVE data

    # If tha data in the setup hook gets chnaged it will not reflect the data in the component. Because they are NOT REACTIVE data
