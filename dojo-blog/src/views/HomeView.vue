/*
    # To use data comming from setup hook into our Vue component we have to return those data in object format

    # return {name, EmpId: id};
    # From above return statement we can obser two diffrent patterns
    # Here name is retured as name. So we can use that as name in our components
    # But id is returned as EmpId. So we can use id as EmpId in our components.


    # If we want to access function defined in setup then they also must be returned from setup     function as show in above example

    ``````````````````````````````````` NOTE ````````````````````````````````````````````````````

    # If tha data in the data hook gets chnaged it will reflect the data in the component as well. Because they are REACTIVE data

    # If tha data in the setup hook gets chnaged it will not reflect the data in the component. Because they are NOT REACTIVE data


    ``````````````````````````````````` NEW NOTE ````````````````````````````````````````````````````

    # If you want to make any variable in setup to become REACTIVE we can use REF's for that like below shown.

    # let name = ref("sivaji"); then the variable name can be dynamic and it will render component when ever name has changed its value.

    # If we want to update value of a refs variable it will be like this name.value = "Naga Sivaji"

    # if we want to show the value of a refs variable in component it will be like name only. No need of name.value
